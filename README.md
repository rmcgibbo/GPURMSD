GPURMSD : Plugin for MSMBuilder
===============================

This is a plugin for [MSMBuilder](https://github.com/simtk/msmbuilder) that installs a GPU-accelerated RMSD code
for clustering molecular dynamcics trajectories. Credit to @protenner wrote all of the CUDA code.

Install this package, and then MSMBuilder's `Cluster.py` will show up with a new metric, GPURMSD, using the
plugin mechanism.
